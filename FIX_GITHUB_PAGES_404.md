# 🔧 Fix GitHub Pages 404 Error

## ❌ Problem
You're seeing: **"There isn't a GitHub Pages site here"** with a 404 error.

## ✅ Solution
GitHub Pages is **NOT enabled** in your repository settings. You must enable it manually.

---

## 🎯 STEP-BY-STEP FIX:

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
**Click this direct link:** 
👉 https://github.com/Aman2711shah/A/settings/pages

Or navigate manually:
1. Go to https://github.com/Aman2711shah/A
2. Click **"Settings"** (top menu bar)
3. Click **"Pages"** (left sidebar, under "Code and automation")

---

### Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages

You'll see a page with "Build and deployment" section.

**IMPORTANT: Choose ONE option below:**

#### ✅ **OPTION A: Deploy from docs/ folder (RECOMMENDED - EASIEST)**

This uses the pre-built files in the `docs/` folder:

1. Under **"Source"**: Select **"Deploy from a branch"**
2. Under **"Branch"**: 
   - First dropdown: Select **"main"**
   - Second dropdown: Select **"/docs"** (NOT "/ (root)")
3. Click the **"Save"** button

#### ✅ **OPTION B: Deploy via GitHub Actions**

This rebuilds the app on every push:

1. Under **"Source"**: Select **"GitHub Actions"**
2. That's it! No other configuration needed.

---

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment

After saving:
- You'll see a message: **"Your site is ready to be published"**
- Wait **1-3 minutes** for GitHub to deploy
- Refresh the page to see: **"Your site is live at https://aman2711shah.github.io/A/"**

---

### Step 4: Access Your Live App

Once deployment completes, visit:

**🌐 https://aman2711shah.github.io/A/**

Your WAZEET app will be live!

## 🔍 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:

After enabling Pages, verify these settings:

### If you chose Option A (docs folder):
- ✅ Source: "Deploy from a branch"
- ✅ Branch: "main"
- ✅ Folder: "/docs"
- ✅ Custom domain: (leave empty)

### If you chose Option B (GitHub Actions):
- ✅ Source: "GitHub Actions"
- ✅ Workflow file exists: `.github/workflows/deploy-web.yml`
- ✅ Latest workflow run succeeded

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### Problem: Still showing 404 after enabling Pages
**Solutions:**
1. Wait 2-3 more minutes and refresh
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R)
3. Verify you selected `/docs` folder, not `/ (root)`
4. Check the branch is `main` not `master`

### Problem: "Page build failed" error
**Solutions:**
1. Make sure `.nojekyll` file exists in `docs/` folder ✅ (already created)
2. Use Option A (docs folder) instead of Option B

### Problem: Blank white page loads
**Solutions:**
1. Check console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
2. Verify the URL is `https://aman2711shah.github.io/A/` (with capital A)
3. Clear cache and reload

### Problem: GitHub Actions workflow failing
**Solutions:**
1. Use Option A (docs folder) - it's simpler
2. Or check the Actions tab for specific error messages

## 📱 AFTER IT WORKS:

Once your site is live, you can:

✅ Share `https://aman2711shah.github.io/A/` with anyone  
✅ Test on mobile by opening the link on your phone  
✅ Bookmark it for quick access  
✅ Add it to your home screen as a PWA (Progressive Web App)  

### Future Updates:
- **If using docs/ folder:** Run `flutter build web --release --base-href /A/`, copy files to `docs/`, commit and push
- **If using GitHub Actions:** Just commit and push to `main` - it rebuilds automatically
