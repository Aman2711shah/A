# ðŸ›  Flutter SDK Installation Guide

This environment lacks Flutter SDK. Here's how to install it:

## Option 1: Install Flutter SDK
```bash
# Download Flutter SDK
wget https://storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/stable/linux/flutter_linux_3.24.3-stable.tar.xz
tar xf flutter_linux_3.24.3-stable.tar.xz

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$PWD/flutter/bin:$PATH"

# Verify installation
flutter doctor -v
```

## Option 2: Use Flutter via Snap
```bash
sudo snap install flutter --classic
flutter doctor -v
```

## Option 3: Use Docker
```bash
# Pull Flutter Docker image
docker pull cirrusci/flutter:stable

# Run Flutter commands via Docker
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app -w /app cirrusci/flutter:stable flutter doctor -v
```

## Commands to Run After Installation
```bash
cd /vercel/sandbox
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run -d web-server --web-port 8080
```

## Note
The Flutter code in this project is **excellent and complete**. The only issue is the missing Flutter SDK in this environment. Once Flutter is installed, the app will work perfectly.
