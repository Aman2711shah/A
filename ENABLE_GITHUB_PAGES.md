# 🚀 ENABLE GITHUB PAGES - STEP BY STEP

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You must enable GitHub Pages manually!

GitHub Actions cannot automatically enable GitHub Pages - you need to do this in your repository settings.

---

## 📋 FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS:

### Step 1: Go to Repository Settings
1. Open this link in your browser: https://github.com/Aman2711shah/A/settings/pages
2. Or navigate manually: GitHub.com → Your Repository "A" → Settings (top menu) → Pages (left sidebar)

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages
You'll see a section called "Build and deployment"

**Choose ONE of these options:**

#### ✅ OPTION A: Use docs folder (EASIEST - RECOMMENDED)
- **Source:** Select "Deploy from a branch"
- **Branch:** Select "main"  
- **Folder:** Select "/docs" (not "/ (root)")
- Click **"Save"** button

#### ✅ OPTION B: Use GitHub Actions
- **Source:** Select "GitHub Actions"
- The workflow will automatically run
- No other settings needed

### Step 3: Wait for Deployment
- GitHub will show: "Your site is ready to be published"
- Wait 1-3 minutes for the first deployment
- Refresh the page to see: "Your site is live at..."

### Step 4: Access Your App
Your live URL will be: **https://aman2711shah.github.io/A/**

## 🎯 VISUAL GUIDE:

When you open the Pages settings, you should see:

```
Build and deployment
├── Source: [Deploy from a branch ▼]  ← SELECT THIS
├── Branch: [main ▼] [/docs ▼]        ← SELECT THESE
└── [Save] button                     ← CLICK THIS
```

---

## ✅ HOW TO VERIFY IT WORKED:

1. After saving, scroll up on the Pages settings page
2. You should see a green box with: "Your site is live at https://aman2711shah.github.io/A/"
3. Click the "Visit site" button
4. Your WAZEET app should load!

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING:

### Problem: "Site not found" or 404 error
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you selected "/docs" folder (not "/ (root)")
- Wait 2-3 minutes and refresh
- Check that branch is "main" not "master"

### Problem: GitHub Actions workflow failing
**Solution:**
- Use Option A (docs folder) instead
- It's simpler and doesn't require Actions permissions

### Problem: Blank page loads
**Solution:**
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Make sure the URL is: https://aman2711shah.github.io/A/ (with capital A)

## 📱 AFTER IT'S LIVE:

Once your site is live at https://aman2711shah.github.io/A/, you can:

✅ Share the link with anyone  
✅ Test on mobile devices  
✅ See it on any browser worldwide  
✅ It updates automatically when you push to main

## 🎊 THAT'S IT!

Just follow Step 1 & 2, wait a few minutes, and your app will be live!
