# Google Play Store Publishing Guide for WAZEET App

## Prerequisites Checklist

### ‚úÖ App Information
- **App Name**: WAZEET
- **Package Name**: com.wazeet.ai
- **Version**: 1.0.0+1
- **Application ID**: com.wazeet.ai

### üìã Required Steps for Play Store Publishing

## Step 1: Create a Google Play Console Account

1. Go to [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Pay the one-time $25 registration fee
4. Complete your developer profile
5. Accept the Developer Distribution Agreement

## Step 2: Create App Signing Key (Production Keystore)

You'll need to create a production keystore for signing your app. Currently, your app uses debug signing.

### Generate Production Keystore:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/wazeet-release-key.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias wazeet-key
```

**Important**: 
- Store the keystore file safely - you'll need it for all future updates
- Remember the passwords - write them down securely
- Never share or lose this keystore

## Step 3: Configure Release Signing

Create a file `android/key.properties`:

```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEY_PASSWORD
keyAlias=wazeet-key
storeFile=/path/to/your/wazeet-release-key.jks
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security**: Add `android/key.properties` to your `.gitignore` file!

## Step 4: Update Android Build Configuration

The `android/app/build.gradle` needs to be updated for production signing.

## Step 5: Build Production APK/AAB

### For AAB (Recommended by Google):
```bash
flutter build appbundle --release
```

### For APK:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

## Step 6: App Store Assets Required

### App Icon
- High-res icon: 512x512 PNG
- Feature graphic: 1024x500 PNG

### Screenshots (Required)
- Phone screenshots: At least 2, up to 8
- Tablet screenshots: At least 1 (if targeting tablets)
- Sizes: Various based on device

### App Description
- Short description (80 characters max)
- Full description (4000 characters max)
- What's new section for updates

## Step 7: Privacy Policy & Compliance

### Required Documentation:
1. **Privacy Policy** (hosted on a publicly accessible URL)
2. **App content rating** questionnaire
3. **Target audience** selection
4. **Data safety** form completion

### Content Policy Compliance:
- Review Google Play's content policies
- Ensure your app doesn't violate any guidelines
- Complete data safety section accurately

## Step 8: Upload to Play Console

1. **Create New App**:
   - Choose app name: "WAZEET"
   - Select language and country
   - Choose app type: App or Game

2. **App Content**:
   - Upload app icon
   - Add screenshots
   - Write app description
   - Add feature graphic

3. **Release Management**:
   - Upload AAB/APK file
   - Add release notes
   - Choose release track (Internal testing ‚Üí Production)

## Step 9: Testing Strategy

### Recommended Release Flow:
1. **Internal Testing**: Upload to internal testing track first
2. **Closed Testing**: Test with a small group of users
3. **Open Testing**: Optional public beta
4. **Production**: Final release to all users

## Step 10: App Review Process

- Google reviews all new apps
- Process typically takes 1-3 days
- May take up to 7 days for first submission
- Address any review feedback promptly

## Additional Considerations

### App Bundle vs APK
- **AAB (Recommended)**: Google Play App Bundle - smaller downloads, dynamic delivery
- **APK**: Traditional format, larger file size

### Versioning
- Update `version` in `pubspec.yaml` for each release
- Version code must increase with each update

### App Updates
- Use the same keystore for all updates
- Follow semantic versioning
- Test updates thoroughly before release

## Monetization (If Applicable)
- Set up Google Play Billing (if selling in-app purchases)
- Configure pricing and availability
- Set up tax information

## Marketing & Optimization
- Use App Store Optimization (ASO) techniques
- Create compelling app descriptions
- Use relevant keywords
- Encourage user reviews and ratings

## Support & Maintenance
- Monitor app performance in Play Console
- Respond to user reviews
- Keep app updated with latest Flutter/Android versions
- Monitor crash reports and fix issues promptly
