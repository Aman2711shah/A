## 🧩 Profile Management Module

The profile experience now uses Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Firebase Storage to deliver secure, per-user profile data.

### Added Dependencies
- firebase_auth
- cloud_firestore
- firebase_storage
- image_picker
- provider

Ensure Firebase is configured for your bundle IDs before running the app.

### Firebase Initialisation
`main.dart` bootstraps Firebase (skipping web if configuration is absent) and wires `UserRepository` + `ProfileController` through a top-level `MultiProvider`. The `MaterialApp` routes now expose:
- LoginScreen.routeName (`/auth/login`)
- EditProfileScreen.routeName (`/profile/edit`)

### Manual QA
1. Launch the app, log in via the email/password flow (`More` tab will redirect if unauthenticated).
2. Open the `More` tab → Profile card shows the authenticated user's name and email.
3. Tap `Edit Profile`, update name/phone, optionally upload an avatar, and save. Snackbar confirms success and the card refreshes.
4. Tap `Logout`; the tab prompts for login again.

### Tests
```bash
flutter test test/features/profile/edit_profile_screen_test.dart
```

### Firestore Security Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /users/{uid} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
    }
  }
}
```

### Storage Rules
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /profileImages/{uid}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == uid;
    }
  }
}
```

### Run Commands
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run
```
