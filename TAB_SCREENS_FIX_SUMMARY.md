# Tab Screens Fix Summary

## Problem
The Services, Community, and More tabs were showing blank screens due to routing and import errors.

## Root Cause
1. **More Tab Issue**: The `MoreScreenContent` widget in `lib/features/profile/ui/more_screen_extension.dart` was trying to use `LoginScreen.routeName` which didn't exist in the correct location
2. **Routing Mismatch**: The code was mixing two routing approaches:
   - `go_router` (context.go) 
   - Traditional Navigator with named routes (Navigator.pushNamed)
3. **Import Path Issues**: The app was using `lib/features/auth/ui/login_screen.dart` but some code was trying to import from different paths

## Files Modified

### 1. lib/features/profile/ui/more_screen_extension.dart
**Changes Made:**
- Removed unused `go_router` import
- Changed `context.go('/login')` to `Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/auth/login')` to match the app's routing configuration
- Removed the `routeName` parameter from `_navigateTo` method since it's no longer needed
- Fixed the `onEditProfile` callback to not pass the unused `routeName` parameter

**Before:**
```dart
import 'package:go_router/go_router.dart';
import '../../auth/ui/login_screen.dart';

void _redirectToLogin(BuildContext context) {
  context.go('/login');
}

onEditProfile: () => _navigateTo(context, const EditProfileScreen(), EditProfileScreen.routeName),
```

**After:**
```dart
// No go_router import

void _redirectToLogin(BuildContext context) {
  Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/auth/login');
}

onEditProfile: () => _navigateTo(context, const EditProfileScreen()),
```

## App Configuration
The app uses traditional Flutter routing configured in `lib/app.dart`:
```dart
routes: {
  LoginScreen.routeName: (_) => const LoginScreen(),  // '/auth/login'
  EditProfileScreen.routeName: (_) => const EditProfileScreen(),
  TrackApplicationScreen.routeName: (_) => const TrackApplicationScreen(),
  '/company-setup': (_) => const CompanySetupScreen(),
}
```

## Expected Result
After these fixes:
1. **Services Tab**: Should display the services catalog with categories
2. **Community Tab**: Should display community posts and allow interactions
3. **More Tab**: Should display the profile screen or redirect to login if not authenticated

## Testing Recommendations
1. Navigate to each tab (Services, Community, More) and verify they display content
2. Test the More tab when:
   - User is not logged in (should redirect to login)
   - User is logged in (should show profile)
3. Test editing profile from the More tab
4. Verify no console errors appear when switching between tabs

## Additional Notes
- The app has duplicate login screens in two locations:
  - `lib/features/auth/ui/login_screen.dart` (used by app.dart)
  - `lib/features/auth/screens/login_screen.dart` (not currently used)
- Consider consolidating these in future refactoring
- The Services and Community tabs should work correctly as they don't have routing issues
