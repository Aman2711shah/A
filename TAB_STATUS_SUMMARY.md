## Test Coverage

### ‚úÖ Tests Created
- `test/features/profile/edit_profile_screen_test.dart` - ‚úÖ Working
- `test/features/home/home_content_screen_test.dart` - ‚è≥ Needs refinement
- `test/features/services/services_screen_test.dart` - ‚è≥ Needs refinement

### Repository Stubbing Pattern

**Template** (from profile tests):
```dart
class _FakeUserRepository implements IUserRepository {
  UserProfile? _profile;

  @override
  Future<UserProfile?> getCurrent() async => _profile;

  @override
  Future<void> upsert(UserProfile data) async {
    _profile = data;
  }

  @override
  Future<String> uploadProfileImage(XFile file) async =>
      'https://example.com/mock.png';

  // ... other methods
}
```

**Apply This Pattern To**:
- DashboardRepository (when created)
- ServiceRequestRepository (when created)
- ApplicationRepository (when created)
- CompanyRepository (when created)
